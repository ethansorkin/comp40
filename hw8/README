Correctly implemented:
    We correctly implemented a reverse polish notation calculator using 
umasm. This calculator can perform all operations outlined in the spec. 

Departures from recommeded calling convention:
    We did not use a call stack. Instead, we were careful with our registers
such that we did not need to make use of a call stack. In its place, we have
a temporary stack that we use for printing. 
As for our registers: we don't always use r1 for the return address. Sometimes
    we use this register to hold temporary value or the user's input. 

Implementation of print module:
    For our print module, we have multiple cases: positive numbers, negative
numbers and the most negative number. We are careful with our registers such
that we did not need a seperate case for printing zero. 

Approximately how many hours we spent analyzing the assignment: 5 hours

Approximately how many hours we spent writing assembly code: 9 hours

Approximately how many hours we spent debugging our calculator: 8 hours
